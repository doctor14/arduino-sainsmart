# TODO

* 5 - 2: gripper
* button to switch elbow and roll to pitch and wrist
* add rspec to CI
* synchronous point-to-point for samples of cartesian path (fly-by-point)
* speed: sin^2 profile (sin^2+cos^2=1) with x in [0, pi] for interpolation (Klaus WÃ¼st),
  acceleration is 2 cos(x) sin(x), position is 1/2 (x - 1/2 sin(2x))
* off-board path planning
* inverse kinematic
* speech control
* serial control
* XBox controller (rotation- and translation mode), python-pygame
* audio output
* machine vision
* servos with feedback
* visualise nominal vs actual position
* instructions (screw terminal)
